According to the existing research, more than 70% of college students procrastinate, with 20% consistently doing it. As a result, students tend to perform very low in their academic performance because of the pandemic situation, which is currently on going, most of the academic activities are carried in an online environment. Therefore, students have less access to campus facilities and structured support from instructors and they are more attracted into digital media to access the online environment. As a side effect, students tend to use more social media while neglecting academic activities which leads to procrastination. Because of this constant procrastination on social media, it will eventually lead to depression status. According to further analysis done, they have suggested some tips to overcome procrastination such as manage motivation, manage goals, tasks and time, etc. But the problem is with this current situation, are those applicable? As a solution, some procrastination tracking tools have been invented which some of the popular tools are mentioned in “existing products” section.  
Out of some leading existing tools and trackers which are developed to identify procrastination and depression among students and other users, one significant tool is Digital Well-being, which a very popular tool as it is Google product which comes pre-installed to most of the android smartphones in the current market.  According to the existing products, “Digital Wellbeing, which was announced in May 2018 Google’s I/O event, is a new initiative to give users a healthier relationship with their technological devices”. The app which is built into Google’s Android operating system enables monitoring of all user activity on the device, showing how much time is spent on the device. According to further explanations, all those detailed information can then be used to diagnose ones’ habits and set limits to better manages ones’ time. When considering all the facts, it is clear that the Digital Wellbeing mobile application is developed to identify up to some level of procrastination done by the user as it tracks how much time the user has used apps and device. There is no clear evidence that the Digital Wellbeing app target social networking sites to monitor user’s procrastination level, instead it tracks down only the usage duration of the app. This is one key factor and research gap that we want to cover in our expected system, which targets more into social networking sites (social media).

<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:georgia;background-color:grey;color:white;line-height:1cm;border-style:groove;border-color:black;border-width:10px;text-align:justify;margin:25px;text-indent:15%;padding:10px;"> In a chatbot, a software program keeps up the conversation with the user by providing right answers for the questions, asked by the user. Chatbots can be used to evaluate user’s attitudes and current mental status at the time user uses it.
According to the way how chatbots work, it can be classified into three categories. In first category, chatbot is run based on pattern matching and these kind of chatbots classify texts and produce a response based on the keywords you see. Pattern matching chatbots are programmed based on Artificial Intelligence Markup Language. In pattern-matching, the chatbot only knows answers to questions that exist in their models. The bot cannot go beyond the patterns already implemented into its system.
In second category, chatbot uses algorithms. For each kind of question, a unique pattern needs to be available in a database for the bot to provide the right response. The classic algorithm for these kind of chatbots are Multinational Naïve Bayes.
The third crucial methodology for chatbots are using artificial neural networks. These neural networks give the bots a way to calculate the response to a question using weighted connections and context in data. With artificial neural networks, each sentence provided to a bot is broken down into different words, and each word is used as an input for the neural network. Over time, the neural network becomes stronger and more advanced, helping the bot to create a more accurate set of responses to common queries.
In modern chatbots, machine learning is used as an AI capability to understand humans and respond accurately to them. The combination of machine learning power of natural language processing and natural language understanding, make the possibility of giving the experience of a real human conversation.
AI-powered Natural Language Processing, or NLP, enables chatbots to mimic human conversation. They can identify the underlying intent behind the text a real person types, then deliver a response that matches that intent.
Chatbots with Natural Language Processing can now “learn” from past conversations and improve their ability to provide appropriate responses and solutions and with this advanced level of processing, they’re becoming extremely helpful in customer service situations.

In usual face-to-face human conversations, people can understand others who are in depressed mental situations by how they behave in the conversation and their on-going attitudes. This same concept can be implemented into the functionality of AI based chatbot applications.
By understanding some one’s attitudes by analyzing the text conversations between a human and a chatbot, a chatbot can make predictions on whether he / she is on a depressed mental situation or not. In any given point, if somebody response in a negative manner for the questions asked by a chatbot, those circumstances will be taken separately and at the end of the conversation season, chatbot can identify as that particular person has depression. 
According to the proposed AI chatbot from this study, Singlish messaging format (Sinhala phrases written using English letters) will be used as the communication medium, and it increases the number of users of this chat application since Singlish has been the widely used language to text among each other in Sri Lanka.
Up to now, all other available chat applications use either Sinhala language or English language as the texting medium and because of that this study propose chat application will provide new experience to the users and it will guide them to get rid of depression and stressfulness of the university students.
In other chatbot applications available on the market do not provide a report based on the evaluations about the user and it only carry out the role of a usual chatbot application.

As a result, students tend to perform very low in their academic performance and because of the pandemic situation, which is currently on going, most of the academic activities are carried in an online environment. Therefore, students have less access to campus facilities and structured support from instructors and they are more attracted into digital media to access the online environment.

Because of this constant procrastination on social media, it will eventually lead to depression status. According to further analysis, they have suggested some tips to overcome procrastination such as manage motivation, manage goals, tasks and time, etc. But the problem is with this current situation, are those applicable? As a solution, some procrastination and depression tracking tools have been invented which some of the popular tools are mentioned in “existing products” section.  
Out of the mentioned existing products, SentBuk is a Facebook application which is developed. SentBuk retrieves messages written by users in Facebook and classifies them according to their polarity, showing the results to the users through an interactive interface. It also supports emotional change detection, friend’s emotion finding, user classification according to their messages, and statistics, among others. The classification method implemented in SentBuk follows a hybrid approach: it combines lexical-based and machine-learning techniques. The results obtained through this approach show that it is feasible to perform sentiment analysis in Facebook with high accuracy (83.27%). 
When it comes to Sri Lankan context, there is a considerable difference when it comes to analyzing Facebook procrastination and depression when compared to existing products. The main drawback is language barrier. Nowadays, according to statistics done in Sri Lanka, there were about roughly 6.5 million Facebook users in January 2020 which is accounted for 30.3% of its entire population. Out of them, there were about 27.9% of Facebook user falls under the age category 18-24. Another research show that anywhere between 85% to 99% of college students use Facebook. The largest age group is currently 18-24 with total of 642,360 users, followed by the users in the age of 25-34. 68% of these users are male and 32% are female users. So, by analyzing those statistical data, we can say that majority of young students are using Facebook on daily basis. Most of then currently use the native language Sinhala to post and comment. Therefore, since the existing products doesn’t support native languages like Sinhala, there is no point of using those to track user’s procrastination and depression while using Facebook.

Above image contains some text which can be identified as a negative and depressive text. But since the text is in Sinhala language, existing tools cannot identify whether the text expresses negative and depressive feeling. In detail comparison is provided in the “Research Gap” section of this document.

<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:georgia;background-color:grey;color:white;line-height:1cm;border-style:groove;border-color:black;border-width:10px;text-align:justify;margin:25px;text-indent:15%;padding:10px;"> Twitter is basically a text-based social media platform where users are allowed to share their opinions in the form of tweets, using only 140 characters. This leads to people compacting their statements by using slang, abbreviations, emoticons, short forms etc. Along with this, people convey their opinions by using sarcasm and polysemy. Therefore we can state that the Twitter language is unstructured.
There was no any statistical data of twitter users in Sri Lanka for all these years and people referred different numbers to depict the size. Recently Twitter advertising platform was rolled out to all the countries in the world and this platform gives some statistics of twitter users in Sri Lanka. According to the Twitter advertising platform, there are about 103,000 male users and 16,000 female users in Sri Lanka, accumulating 119,000 Twitter users altogether as at December 2015.

In the modern context, the numbers are dominantly huge. In Sri Lanka, currently almost every student, teenagers and university undergraduates use Twitter and with the invention of Sinhala typing keyboard applications, tweets can be sent in pure Sinhala language. As a result, Twitter is now popular as much as Facebook. Also, Twitter is a very light weight social media application with simple UI when compared to apps like Facebook. Therefore, even people who never used any kind of social media platform before, begin to enter to the world of social media via Twitter. As the audience get incremented, positive content and as well as negative content will be added to the platform rapidly. Therefore, keeping track of the content that users are experiencing in Twitter while they are browsing social media, is a very crucial fact to be concerned. Students and teenagers can easily be brainwashed with simple Tweets. Other than that, because of this pandemic situation, students are stuck inside digital platforms like Twitter, which eventually lead to academic procrastination and depression. 
According to analysis, they have suggested some tips to overcome procrastination such as manage motivation, manage goals, tasks and time, etc. But the problem is with this current situation, are those applicable? As a solution, some procrastination and depression tracking tools have been invented which some of the popular tools are mentioned in “existing products” section.

However, after analyzing those products thoroughly, we identified a research gap which they do not address but which are more important and essential when analyzing user’s procrastination and depression effectively. Specially in a country like Sri Lanka, those products might not perform very well because of the behavioral patterns and language barriers. Most importantly, those products do not very much effective when it comes to tracking user’s social media lifestyle. The following table implies a comparison of features between existing products and our expectations. </p>

It is viewed within physiological research as a self-regulation failure. This procrastination is very much common among students and university undergraduates as they purposely delay important tasks like assignment submissions because of procrastinating which results in losing their self-regulation and academic under-achievement. Self-regulation refers to our ability to make use of  our  cognitive,  emotional, and behavioural resources to  achieve  a goal or outcome.   Procrastination and depression may be exacerbated by technologies such as social media and smartphones. These days, because of this pandemic situation, every university/school tend to conduct their academic activities in an online environment. Because of this, students tend  to  use  social  media  and  smartphones  more,  than  usual  days,  which  will  lead  to incrementing procrastination. Most students tend to use the internet during lecture hours, not only to search lecture related content but social media. This type of procrastination is called  Cyberslacking.    This  cyberslacking  behaviour  affects  students’  educational performance and damages their cognitive and retention abilities.  When discussing depression, according to a meta-analysis done by a research group, the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms during COVID-19 have doubled, compared with pre-pandemic estimates, and moderator analysis revealed that prevalence rates were higher when collected in the pandemic in teenagers. So,  as  you  can  see,  using  social  media  is  one  of  the  main  key  pillars  to  increase procrastination and also depression among students. A research study was done in 2016 found out that most of the students spend up to 40% of their time on social media during study activities. Balancing both social media use and academic activities is very crucial for students, and it is identified as a new form of classic self-control dilemma.  Therefore, in order to minimize procrastination and be a more productive student, there must be a way to track procrastination. Nowadays, there are so many apps that are used to track app usage like “Digital Wellbeing”, but the issue is, up to now there is no single app that does this task automatically and by using machine learning. Therefore we, as our final year research project, want to bridge this gap by providing a more sustainable way of tracking procrastination and depression using the latest machine learning techniques for both mobile and desktop users.  </p>
